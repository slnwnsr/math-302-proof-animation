## Proof of R(4,4) Without Words
A proof without words of the Ramsey Number R(4,4) = 18, showing that if you colour a complete graph K18 with red and blue, you will not be able to avoid either a red monochromatic K4 subgraph or a blue monochromatic K4 subgraph. K18 is the smallest graph that has this property. Made using Manim (community-maintained version).

- Part 1 shows that you cannot avoid the above in K18 (proving R(4,4) <= 18)

- Part 2 shows that a 2-colouring of K17 that avoids the above exists (proving R(4,4) = 18)
