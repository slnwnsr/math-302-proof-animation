## Proof of R(4,4) Without Words
A proof without words of the Ramsey number R(4,4) = 18, showing that if you colour the edges of a complete graph K18 with red and blue, you will not be able to avoid either a red-monochromatic K4 subgraph or a blue-monochromatic K4 subgraph. K18 is the smallest graph that has this property. Made using Manim (community-maintained version).

- Part 1 shows that you cannot avoid a monochromatic K4 subgraph in K18 using the theorem R(s,t) <= R(s-1,t) + R(s,t-1), proving R(4,4) <= 18

- Part 2 shows that a 2-colouring of K17 that avoids a monochromatic K4 subgraph exists, proving R(4,4) = 18
